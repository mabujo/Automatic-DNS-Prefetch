This plugin speeds up your page load speed by adding DNS prefetch statements for external libraries.

== Description ==

Modern browsers allow pages to prefetch DNS records of external libraries. This plugin looks through WordPress enqueued scripts and styles and adds DNS prefetch statements for scripts and stylesheets added by other plugins.

This means that when the browser comes to download an external script or stylesheet, it already has looked up the DNS record for the external domain, and can proceed immediately to downloading the script, saving latency during loading of external resources.
